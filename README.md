Site Owner Goals
As a developer of this program, my goals was..

..To build a program that can store and add information.
..Make it easy for user to understand and how to use it.
..To make functions that add and store user inputs in API google sheets.
..Create functions like add a contact, open exisiting contacts and delete.
..Make a readable code as much as possible. 
..strengthen my comprehension about user experience design because it will be my next course to study if needed.
..Trying to think when using the app like an unsophisticated user.

The Structure is what you can see in the flowchart here. There is six different task from a menu that get the user to the different functions depending on what the user input. Every function has a way to get back to the menu or quit the programme after the task is done. In the flowchart every function has a own colour just to make it easy to follow.
